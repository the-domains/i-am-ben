  What a fun, beautiful and horrible weekend. There was a party at somebody's
  grandparents' house in Severna Park. It's by Chesapeake Bay and it couldn't be
  a better place for some Memorial Weekend fun.

What a fun, beautiful and horrible weekend. There was a party at somebody's grandparents' house in Severna Park. It's by Chesapeake Bay and it couldn't be a better place for some Memorial Weekend fun.

I tried to find pictures off the internet that could do the place justice but this is the best I could find.

Basically it has hilly, jagged harbors. The backyard is a peninsula jutting out from the end of the street.

The sun, good people, games, water, boats, inflatable jumping devices, you name it. I had a fantastic time. During the night, I tripped or something while talking to somebody and took a bad tumble head-first down a sharp slope. My friend said once I landed on my face, my back jackknifed---my legs almost touched the back of my head.

The next day, I had scrapes on my face and my forearms and bruises all over, but otherwise I felt fine. I could toss a football back and forth.

But after taking a nap, my back was killing me. I finally could move around a bit only after poppin' in a coupla Advils. Since my friend thought for a second I might become quadriplegic from the look of my fall, I gotta count my blessings. The whole half-full glass shizz, yeahh.

Oh yeah, I "graduated". The funniest memory of the ceremonies is watching a drunk Joe V. wandering around on the stage before Mr. Pramuk gave him a good nudge to get him off the platform---I was disappointed that it happened outside the video clip's frame. I still gotta finish a coupla courses this June before I get my degree.
